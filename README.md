# Introduction to MuJoCo

MuJoCo is a free and open source physics engine that aims to facilitate research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation, and other areas where fast and accurate simulation is needed.

- **MuJoCo** stands for **Mu**lti-**Jo**int dynamics with **Co**ntact
- It is a (rigid-body) simulator
- In my personal opinion, a (proper) simulator consists of:
    - Rigid-body simulation by solving an equation of motion (e.g., an articulated body algorithm)
    - Contact solver (main cause of sim-to-real gap)
    - Easy-to-use visualizer (**VERY IMPORTANT** for conducting research)
